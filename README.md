## Temperature Calculator

The Temperature Calculator allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user is prompted to enter a temperature and choose the conversion method.

### Functions

- **`celsius_to_fahrenheit(to_convert_ct)`**: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- **`fahrenheit_to_celsius(to_convert_tc)`**: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.

## Ohm's Law Calculator

The Ohm's Law Calculator enables users to calculate voltage, current, or resistance based on the user's input. It takes into account various conditions such as short circuits and open circuits.

### Functions

- **`find_voltage(current, resistance)`**: Calculates voltage based on current and resistance.
- **`find_current(voltage, resistance)`**: Calculates current based on voltage and resistance.
- **`find_resistance(current, voltage)`**: Calculates resistance based on current and voltage.

## Diamond Shape Maker

The Diamond Shape Maker creates a diamond shape based on the specified width. The width must be a positive odd integer.

### Functions

- **`print_diamond(width)`**: Prints a diamond shape with the given width.
